6.1 The Heavy Pill: 
You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills,
 but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that 
 provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle?
 You can only use the scale once.

Approach:
Take one pill from bottle #1, two pills from Bottle #2, three pills from Bottle #3
and so on. If all pills were 1 gm, total weight would be (1+2+3+....+20) = 20*21/2 = 210
This formula will tell you bottle number:
		          weight - 210 gram
	Bottle # =    ------------------
		             0.1 gram
Eg: if weight = 211.3 gm, then bottle no is 13.
